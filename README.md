# ScuffedWalls (Deprecated)
```
ScuffedWalls is no longer under active developement. The quality of code being unworkable and the need from the beat saber community 
dying down makes this program officially deprecated. It is currently in a working state (just barely) and is still usable for wallmaps / notemaps.

I do not ever plan to remove ScuffedWalls from github. It is still special to me and to many others even if its a little scuffed.

Changes are still welcome via pull requests and direct messages.

A command line tool designed as an alternative to scripting Noodle Extensions maps.

This tool does not do the same thing as [`Beatwalls`](https://github.com/spookyGh0st/beatwalls) from spookyGh0st.

## Quick Start
  - Place the program in the map folder or [`drag the map folder onto the .exe`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/154HyzH-xqE7AuoDrKM9p0_MZtH_f-F_r/view?usp=sharing)
  - Open the program
  - Follow the prompts until a `.sw` file is generated
  - Put your code in the generated `_ScuffedWalls.sw` file. 
  - Save the `_ScuffedWalls.sw` file to refresh the program.

*Windows will probably bother you about this being malware. If you dont trust it, clone the repo and build it yourself.*

If everything doesnt work and your in a country that uses , as the decimal symbol, [`changing regional settings`](Images/regional.png) is a common fix.
